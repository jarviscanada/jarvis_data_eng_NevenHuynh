# Neven Huynh . Jarvis Consulting

Driven, detail-oriented, and passionate about creating impactful solutions, I am a recent graduate from York University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My academic background has equipped me with strong technical skills and a solid foundation in software development using technologies like Java, Docker, and PostgreSQL. Some of my key projects include a stock quote app, a shoe store website, and an image classification model. Excited by the ever-evolving nature of the software industry, I thrive on continuous learning and am eager to contribute to innovative, high-impact projects.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NevenHuynh](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NevenHuynh)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NevenHuynh/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed an automated system to monitor server performance metrics across a network of Linux servers. It collects hardware specifications as well as resource usage data (e.g. CPU, memory, disk) in real-time utilising bash scripts and crontab to automate the execution of the scripts. The data is then saved in a PostgreSQL database hosted in a Docker container.

**Grep App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NevenHuynh/tree/master/core_java/grep)]: Developed a Java based tool that mimics the usage of the grep command in Linux. The app recursively searches a specified file directory for any files and searches each file for a line of text matching a specified regular expression. All matching lines are then outputted to an output file specified by the user. The application was dockerized as a Docker image, available on DockerHub.

**Stock Quote App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NevenHuynh/tree/master/core_java/jdbc)]: Created a command-line application that allows users to manage a simulated stock portfolio with real-time stock data. It utilizes the Alpha Vantage API to fetch live stock information and maintains portfolio data using a PostgreSQL database. The app ensures data persistence and retrieval through JDBC. The application was dockerized as a Docker image, available on DockerHub.

**Retail Data Analytics with PySpark** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NevenHuynh/tree/master/pyspark/notebooks/Retail%20Data%20Analytics%20with%20Pyspark.ipynb)]: Implemented a data analytics notebook for London Gift Shop (LGS), a London-based retailer, to provide a detailed analytical view of the shop's sales data, growth, users. Utilised Databricks to process the dataset. Customers were analysed using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value) metric and segmented into groups such as 'Loyal Customers' or 'Promising'. 


## Highlighted Projects
**Shoe E-Commerce Store** [[GitHub](https://github.com/stevenhaddadcs/4413-Ecommerce-Shoestore)]: Co-developed a full stack E-Commerce web application for users to browse a shoe store, packaged in Docker. Utilized Jakarta Server Pages (JSP), JavaScript and CSS for front-end development. Created a SQLite database to organize user information, product stock and purchase history. Login/register page was built utilizing SQLite to verify user credentials and developed an admin panel for updating and deleting products and users.

**Support Vector Machine Image Classification**: Created a model which classified images as "outdoors" or "indoors" using a dataset of 800 images. Data was preprocessed by partitioning the images and calculating the mean colour intensities of each partition and utilized the 'e1071' package in R to train the model. Image classification achieved an accuracy of 80%.
