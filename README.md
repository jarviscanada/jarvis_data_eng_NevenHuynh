## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NevenHuynh](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NevenHuynh)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NevenHuynh/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed an automated system to monitor server performance metrics across a network of Linux servers. It collects hardware specifications as well as resource usage data (e.g. CPU, memory, disk) in real-time utilising bash scripts and crontab to automate the execution of the scripts. The data is then saved in a PostgreSQL database hosted in a Docker container.

**RDBMS and SQL** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NevenHuynh/tree/master/sql)]: Practiced SQL skills by completing a compilation of PostgreSQL exercises. The dataset used is a made-up sample country club with a set of members, facilities, and booking history for the facilities.

**Grep App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NevenHuynh/tree/master/core_java/grep)]: Developed a Java based tool that mimics the usage of the grep command in Linux. The app recursively searches a specified file directory for any files and searches each file for a line of text matching a specified regular expression. All matching lines are then outputted to an output file specified by the user. The application was dockerized as a Docker image, available on DockerHub.


## Highlighted Projects
**Shoe E-Commerce Store** [[GitHub](https://github.com/stevenhaddadcs/4413-Ecommerce-Shoestore)]: Co-developed a full stack E-Commerce web application for users to browse a shoe store, packaged in Docker. Utilized Jakarta Server Pages (JSP), JavaScript and CSS for front-end development. Created a SQLite database to organize user information, product stock and purchase history. Login/register page was built utilizing SQLite to verify user credentials and developed an admin panel for updating and deleting products and users.

**Support Vector Machine Image Classification**: Created a model which classified images as "outdoors" or "indoors" using a dataset of 800 images. Data was preprocessed by partitioning the images and calculating the mean colour intensities of each partition and utilized the 'e1071' package in R to train the model. Image classification achieved an accuracy of 80%.
